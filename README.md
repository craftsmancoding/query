Query
=====

Query offers a Snippet interface for xPDO's getCollection method.  This allows you to query 
any MODX database collection and format the output, including pagination.  Query can be used
as a replacement for getResources, and it offers much more flexibility because it's not 
constrained to fetching only resources.
